# Time-table

### It's a very small website where we just login and view the time table of our respective batch and semester .
**I have't used mongodb here as I am still inexperienced in mongodb but in future I will implement it to store to make the website more secure.
And unfortunately the time tables are not customable which I will make in the future again because of my lack of experience in mongodb .**
***But I believe it is still a website worth visiting.***
## By downloading
 **To view the website on your computer npm must be installed .
If so then you can just type npm start in the command line in the same folder to run it.**
	or
## View it online
**You can view the website through this site https://time-table-1.herokuapp.com/**

#### That's it folks
